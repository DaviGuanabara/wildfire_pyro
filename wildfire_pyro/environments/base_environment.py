    def receive_context(self, context: dict):
        """
        Receives contextual data from external components such as callbacks,
        and dispatches the data to the appropriate handler registered in
        `self._context_handlers`.

        This method follows the Hollywood Principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you".
        In this architecture, external components (e.g., EvalCallback) send structured
        information to the environment, and the environment internally decides how to
        handle it, based on pre-registered handlers.

        This allows the user to extend the environment's behavior in a clean,
        decoupled way, without having to modify the core control flow.
        
        Example usage:
            self._context_handlers["EvaluationMetrics"] = self._handle_eval_metrics

        Args:
            context (dict): A dictionary with the following structure:
                {
                    "context_type": str,        # The name of the context class/type (e.g., "EvaluationMetrics")
                    "context_data": Any         # The actual payload, e.g., a dataclass instance
                }

        Note:
            - Handlers must be explicitly registered in the child class.
            - If no handler is found, the context is silently ignored.
            - This design promotes high cohesion and low coupling, and is open for extension
            without requiring changes to the base class.
        """
        context_type = context.get("context_type")
